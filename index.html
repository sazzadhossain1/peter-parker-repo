            <p>A super hero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko 
                and published by Marvel comics. He first appeared 
                in the final edition of Amazing Fantasy, 
                originally titled Amazing Adult Fantasy,
                 in 1962.
    
                The origin of Spider-Man has 
                been told many times in comics, 
                cartoons, TV shows and films.
                 Broadly speaking it is the 
                 story of Peter Parker a nerdy 
                 teenager bitten by a radioactive 
                 spider. This encounter leaves Peter 
                 with spider like speed, strength and 
                 agility. Drunk on his new found power 
                 he goes in search of ways to make money 
                 and after a wrestling show fails to 
                 stop a burgler from stealing the gate 
                 takings at a show. This man goes on to
                  kill his uncle. Realising that he 
                  could have stopped this Peter learns
                   the hard way that "With great power,
                    there must also come great 
                    responsibility". He vows never to 
                    allow anyone to be hurt by 
                    his inaction again.</p>

            <p>A superhero belonging to Marvel Comics.
                 Because of a bite taken from a radioactive
                  spider, young college student Peter Parke
                  r has the ability to climb walls, to 
                  sense danger, and to shoot webs like
                   a spider. He made a costume for a 
                   wrestling match, a burglar shot Peter's
                    Uncle Ben, Peter went after the burglar,
                     and killed him. Peter changed his 
                     costume to the costume we know 
                     today. And that's the origin of
                      Spider-Man.
